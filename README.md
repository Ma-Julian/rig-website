## Getting started with local development

First, this repo uses `pnpm` as a package manager. If you don't have it installed, see [Installing pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Then, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Next, you can run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
