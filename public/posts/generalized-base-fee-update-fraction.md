## Abstract
Ethereumâ€™s blob base fee relies on an update fraction constant, re-specified in each EIP that adjusts the target blob gas. This post shows that both EIP-4844 and EIP-7691 can be unified under a simple generalization, with the update fraction expressed as $b = m / (2 \ln 1.125)$, where $m$ is the max blob gas per block. The generalized form preserves the intended percentage changes across any max:target ratios and exhibits a complementary-ratio symmetry. Finally, it provides a natural bridge to the gas normalization architecture of EIP-7999, where the same fee change factor emerges more directly.
