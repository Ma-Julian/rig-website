## Abstract

This EIP updates the gas cost of state-access operations to reflect Ethereumâ€™s larger state and the consequent slowdown of these operations. It raises the base costs for `GAS_STORAGE_UPDATE`, `GAS_COLD_SLOAD`, and `GAS_COLD_ACCOUNT_ACCESS` and updates the access cost for `EXTCODESIZE` and `EXTCODECOPY`. The design coordinates with EIP-8032: before EIP-8032, parameters assume worst-case contract size; after EIP-8032, they assume worst-case up to `ACTIVATION_THRESHOLD`, with additional depth-based scaling beyond.
