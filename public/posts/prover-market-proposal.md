## Abstract
When zkEVM is implemented on Ethereum, provers must be paid. This post proposes a method for provers to get paid. It uses literature on competition to formulate a mechanism in the context of the Ethereum beacon chain. The main problem is that provers could submit a few proofs if they can create Sybils at a reasonably low cost which puts more strain on the p2p layer.
