## Abstract
This post outlines the considerations for the `BLOB_BASE_COST` in EIP-7918. The reserve price must be high enough that adjustments in the blob base fee meaningfully affect demand, rather than being overshadowed by fixed costs. Furthermore, it would ideally reflect the substantial compute load imposed on validators and nodes from KZG proof verification.
