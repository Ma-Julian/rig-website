From Whiteboard to Mainnet is a new podcast series co-hosted by Columbia University’s Center for Digital Finance and Technologies (CDFT) and the Ethereum Foundation’s Academic Secretariat.

The series brings together academics and Ethereum ecosystem contributors for focused, candid conversations. Each episode explores a specific topic or open problem, pairing leading researchers from academia with contributors from the Ethereum Foundation to share and compare perspectives.

The second episode will be co-hosted by Agostino Capponi (Columbia University), Fahad Saleh (Columbia University/University of Florida), and Shyam Sridhar (Ethereum Foundation), and will feature Urban Jermann (University of Pennsylvania), Ansgar Dietrichs (Ethereum Foundation), and Caspar Schwarz-Schilling (Ethereum Foundation) in a discussion on the economics of Proof-of-Stake Ethereum. The session will open with the recent paper “A Macro Finance Model for Proof-of-Stake Ethereum” by Urban Jermann, and then expand into a broader conversation on the ETH Supply & Issuance Policy.
