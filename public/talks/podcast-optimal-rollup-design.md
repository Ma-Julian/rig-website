From Whiteboard to Mainnet is a new podcast series co-hosted by Columbia University’s Center for Digital Finance and Technologies (CDFT) and the Ethereum Foundation’s Academic Secretariat.

The series brings together academics and Ethereum ecosystem contributors for focused, candid conversations. Each episode explores a specific topic or open problem, pairing leading researchers from academia with contributors from the Ethereum Foundation to share and compare perspectives.

The first episode will be co-hosted by Fahad Saleh (Columbia University/University of Florida), and Shyam Sridhar (Ethereum Foundation), and will feature Ciamac Moallemi (Columbia University), Davide Crapis (Ethereum Foundation), and Maria Silva (Ethereum Foundation) in a discussion on Optimal Rollup Design. The session will open with the recent paper “A Framework for Combined Transaction Posting and Pricing for Layer 2 Blockchains” by Shouqiao Wang, Davide Crapis, and Ciamac C. Moallemi, and then expand into a broader conversation on resource pricing in Layer 2 blockchains.
